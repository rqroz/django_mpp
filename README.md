# Minimum Perimeter Polygon

Minimum Perimerer Polygon (MPP) is a technique used to represent the shape in a given boundary using the fewest possible number of sequences.

More information about this can be found at Chapter 11 of the book Digital Image Processing by Rafael C. Gonzalez, Richard E. Woods.

Important Notes
-----------
1. The django view responsible for performing the MPP calls a binary filed generated from a .cpp script. That being said, it is unlikely that this application will properly run on OS X.

2. For now just ignore (or even delete your copy of) the 'django-mpp' folder.


Quick start
-----------
1. Get a copy of this repo:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/rqroz/django_mpp.git
    ```

2. Change directory to example's folder

    ```
    $ cd example
    ```

2. Start the development server and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/
   and have some fun!

   ```
   $ python3 manage.py runserver
   ```
