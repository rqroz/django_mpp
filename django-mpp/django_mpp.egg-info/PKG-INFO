        Quick start
        -----------
        
        1. Add "mpp" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                ...
                'mpp',
            ]
        
        2. Include the polls URLconf in your project urls.py like this::
        
            path('mpp/', include('mpp.urls')),
        
        3. Go to the mpp's subfolder called 'opencv' and in processor.py you will find:
        
            from django_mpp.settings import BASE_DIR
        
            Change the 'django_mpp' part to the app that was created with the creation
            of your project (it usually has the same name of your project folder).
        
        4. Start the development server and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/mpp/
           and start having fun!
